How does inventory work?
    inventory is always applied if it is available.
    if there is inventory for an item that is set to build then the build of that item will be elided if possible.
    if not possible then the item will still be built.

    if there's inventory for an item that is set to buy then inventory will contribute as much as possible.
    if all required amount of this item is provided by the inventory then nothing will be bought
    otherwise what needs to be purchased will contribute to the cost of the build and will be present in the multibuy.

    if an item is completely supplied by inventory then it does not have a build/buy decision available since, given
    the above behavior, either selection would have no effect.

What items go into the intermediates table? (build/buy table)
    An item is in the intermediates table if it is buildable (also if not a fuel block or t1 thing ... )
    and (if not all of its parents (must have parents) are set to buy or if one of my parents is a target).

    Also, if an item is completely supplied by inventory then build/buy makes no difference.
    However, for UX consistency, it'd be better I think if it did not depend on the schedule.

    Performance
        What is the 'Value'? 'Value' is difference between profit when built and profit when bought.
        value = (profit if built) - (profit if bought)
        I can assume there is a cached schedule. (when underlying build changes then whole schedule is recomputed)

        so on layout I have to compute schedules for each item... (only opposite for each item right?)
        might be slow depending on final imp of scheduler.

    BpOps
        an item has BpOps iff it is not also in the targets table

What is build.yaml again? How does that work?
Automate the "code generation" for drift.

use canvaskit webrenderer
https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/web-renderers

GOAL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One thing I want to be true about this app is that the scenario where it gives the exact answer is very well defined and thought out ahead of time
  I do mfg and rtns in wormhole space using 1 raitaru and 1 tatara.
  All my toons have Reactions V, Indy V, Adv Indy IV, all Science IV
  I have x number of mfg lines and y number of rtn lines
  All my bp's have certain ME/TE levels which I've set either directly per bp or by a global ME/TE option
  All my toons have the same beancounter industry 2% implant
  All my market toons have acounting V
  (mfg tax, rtn tax, cost indices) are all given
  All market data has been fetched within the past half hour for the market hub I am buying from.

  Given all this info, the app should calculate pretty gosh darn exact numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRICTIONS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never build any MFG item that is input to RTN item (fuel blocks)
  Just learned that fuel blocks are basically always only used as input to reactions
  There are not mfg items built by my app that take fuel blocks as inputs.

Assumes structures are located where the rigs give the best bonuses. (LS for thukker rigs)
  ??? this one is annoying, i mean. it basically works for anyone doing everything in ns/wh
  but,
  for people in LS its wrong if they use rigs other than thukker.
    :(
  don't really want to work on it though.

I am not supporting arbitrary systems. Why?
  1: Jita & Amarr are the two best high sec trade hubs.
     If a person does high volume industry for profit (purpose of my app) then they probably are trading in Amarr & Jita.
     They are probably, at least, buying in Amarr & Jita.
     Except possibly they are trading in a large nullsec trade hub.

  2: Supporting private trade hubs would require esi credentials which is something I do not want to do atm.

Note - Large 'Sheriff' Shield Extender Blueprint can drop with 20% ME

Not sure if i will do Structure+Rig
Maybe will just ask for 1rtn and 1mfg structure and for a set of rigs (distinct in item type receiving bonus)
Unfortunately I think it is common to have multiple mfg structures.
Fuck it.
It will work for me to have 1rtn 1mfg.
I mean if I have multiple rtn structures do I then have multiple rtn systems?
I am not going into that much detail.

*** It is practically impossible to get everything perfect ***

Time Efficiency
    Not possible to get perfect times unless you specifiy EVERYTHING which requires too much coding for me and too much configuration for the user.
    And to get perfect timing would require having different bonuses PER LINE in the solver which is impossible with the solver as it is written now.
    Honestly, any solver that optimizes makespan and which uses CP-SAT to do it would be too slow (probably) if coded to have different properties per line.
    Think about it, the number of lines would likely be high, I will have at least 50 mfg lines, many people have more than that.
    Even if I group the lines according to skill/bonuses applied, there is still the worst case of having a lot of groups.
    If I did group by skills/bonuses then I probably would have a lot more coding on my hands (in the GUI and in the solver/approximator)
    In any case, taking ALL skills/bonuses into consideration means asking the user for skills for each toon, asking for blueprint TE levels, asking 
    (potentially) which toons can mfg/react at which structures, asking for each structure what the system cost index is or where it is located.
    Then users would complain that they do not want to type in blueprint TE levels, and so I would code something that automatically fetches all the users blueprints and uses them.
    Then some users would complain that they do not want to use a particular blueprint and that it should be excluded.
    Then other users would want to manually specify TE levels of some blueprints and use those instead of the ones I automatically fetched for them.

    Shit gets fucked if I try to cover every possible scenario.

Material Efficiency
    the above applies here too
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARKET DATA-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apparently indexeddb can hold a lot of data https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5692820/maximum-item-size-in-indexeddb

Application X - Contact 'Dark808bb'

Use concurrent fetch of market data is pretty quick! yay.
So just load all cpp eve market data and cache it into drift
That really is the best way

Now pretty reasonable to add a market data age clock thingy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOOKS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am using flutter master channel because according to a reddit post, material 3 components are only available on the master channel

use defaulttextstyle? or have a list of text style's in my_theme?

Make look good... layout, colors, fonts, better loader (loader kinda sucks, it's aliased)

Get some fonts here https://fonts.google.com/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------------------------------------

DEVELOPMENT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
msix_config for startmenu stuff google 'how to create msix_config windows'
Setup CI? so that people can be sure that exe hosted on github releases has been built by the code
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICONS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I might not show icons in the app. a compact view may be more desirable than showing eye candy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SDE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note there are name -> type conflicts in the SDE. I made a bug report about this on community.eveonline.com

Custom build amounts (set by me) for heuristic profit% calculations in the Browse window // LOW LOW PRIOR
  Idk maybe there is a way to automatically choose build amounts to calculate an approximate profit percent.
  But, if there really is not then I can customize things :/
  But, I'd prefer not to though, if some new item comes to the market, then what do I do?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outputs should all be tables that are paste-able into EXCEL

Have a donate button / bitcoin wallet address.

Have blueprints in inventory (and missing in multibuy)? just for calculating how many blueprints are needed to do the job.
  Interesting, if I did this then I'd want to have a blueprintID to itemID map.
  I guess I would need friggin blueprint names as well...

Multiple Multibuys??? No, better to just link / mention different website that does this.

Add hints to different UI elements to help explain things a bit.
Have a QA section?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILD CUSTOMIZATIONS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot make this program so flexible that it does every calculation perfect for every possible industry scenario.

Instead my strategy is to optimize for the simple case (hopefully common case, I will setup my indy like this).
  ME/TE levels for BPO can be set globally by the user (or take a sensible default)
  ME/TE can be set per bp type.
  Skills are set globally by the user
    science (one option ?), production (one option for each with mat/time bonuses), the reactions skill
  Number of lines for mfg and for rtns are set globally
  Rtn & Mfg system cost indices are set globally.
  There is only one rig for each bonus but more than three rigs can be applied to a build.
    This simulates multiple structures (to a degree). Maybe I do all my equipment mfg in one structure and all my ship mfg in another.
    To make sure the build IRL works exactly as the solver describes it is my responsibility to do (among other things) the correct production in the correct facility.
    If two rigs give the same bonus to the same item, then the best bonus is applied? It's just easier this way.

It is possible to buy intermediates things that are in Target Items.
  If something is in target items then it is always built, but any amount of it used for building other items
  may be bought. Just like how inventory and everything works in the solver.

option to never build rams, fuel blocks, t1 ships, ...???

ERROR HANDLING--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mega sad face
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUI/UX----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flyouts:
   app title
        chooses different app
        If I create more eve apps then could have the title bar be a flyout that navigates between them basically instantly

Having a schedule visualization would be super good. // NO PRIORITY

Tooltips
  Get Market Data : Loads market data from the ESI.
  Value: Profit if built i.e. (Profit if Build) - (Profit if Buy)
  Cost/u : build price per unit
  Sell/u : sale price per unit
  % : Profit percent

TODO have a + sign for positive values in intermediates table so it is more clear that doing the build "Adds" value

Make input boxes simple.
  For integer inputs just restrict input to integers and maximum number of characters
  For percents just restrict max num chars maybe
    Append % sign always ( i think flutter has support for this being always show.. like a 'virtual character')

  When inputs are accepted (on editing done) replace the input with my interpretation of it.
   So user understands that I understand what they input.

  Red box on invalid input

Options ### see BUILD CUSTOMIZATIONS section above for more details about options

meh lets not do implants

    raw/purchased materials (including fuel blocks)
    (name, cost, cost/u)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMINDER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't forget you wrote code for multiple multibuys
    lol i did forget. would be nice to have a 'better' evepraisal that takes into consideration volume and gives best buy/sell hubs with (multimultibuy)

You can use corporation orders. maybe it's like corp reactions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRUCTURE/SKILL BONUSES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
read this https://eve-industry.org/export/IndustryFormulas.pdf

// The following comments are WRONG! but only by a little bit.
//// t2s converts a time to seconds
//// t computes the bonused time with proper rounding
//// so, the total amount of time is independent of how many lines the runs are spread across
//// t2s(t(r,basetime)) == sum_over_any_partition_p_of(r): t2s(t(p,basetime))
//// except, that's not true, its an approximation, not equality
def t(r, b):
    s = r * b * (1 - .2) * (1 - .22)
    d = int(s / (3600 * 24))
    s -= d * 3600 * 24
    h = int(s / 3600)
    s -= h * 3600
    m = int(s / 60)
    s -= m * 60
    return d, h, m, round(s)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL PROFIT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional profit helps you determine if you should build the absolution instead of just selling the intermediates for profit.
If B is used to build A, and there is profit pB in building and selling B and profit pA in building and selling pA, then
  the additional profit for using the B (that you built) to build A is ap = pA - pB. If ap is negative then you loose money in building A. It would be more
  profitable to build the B's and then sell those.
There is 3 problems with additional profit:
  1. There are more considerations than pure profit, such as volume reduction by building A and minimizing risk by selling A's and B's instead of just A's or B's.
  2. Market volume for intermediate items is low, so having intermediates as primary items to sell is not a good idea because a low volume market is less reliable.
     It is better to build primarily A's and maybe build a few B's on the side (depending on market volume of course)
  3. It adds more complexity to the application which is already complex enough.

So I am not going to implement additional profit calculations. But I will leave this section for future reference, lol.

*additional profit can be negative. in the case where it is not profitable to build but there
is not enough decent sell orders on market. (still build cost < buy cost)
*additional profit = total profit for building X - sum(total profit of component Y if we build Y)?????
*additional profit is the amount we make by building X instead of building all Y's and selling them
on market. The total profit of the root is equal to the sum of the additional profits
of each node we build. The amount we could sell a Y for depends on what that Y is.
In theory everything could be sold at min sell. But things like processed moon mats have low volume
at market and so the only feasible way (er the only way i want to try) to liquidate is
to sell to buy orders.
